![](images/3-level-station.jpg)

Before you start building the station, you will need to source all the components listed in our [bill of materials]{BOM}, which is given on the next page.

## Instructions

These instructions will take you through how to assemble the 3-level version of the stage. There is also a [2-level version](https://librehub.github.io/strobe-microscope-2level-version/2-level-station.html) for education or other applications.

The assembly is described in several steps:

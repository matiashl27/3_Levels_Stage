# Strobe-enhanced microscopy stage

The strobe-enhanced microscopy stage is a free and open-source workstation for imaging fast processes, particularly developed for microfluidic droplet generation. It uses the lens from the Raspberry Pi Camera to produce a microscope with a field of view of almost 1mm and a strobe illumination based on a high-power LED for imaging fast-moving objects. Custom electronics allow the synchronization between the LED and the camera to capture sharp images of fast-moving droplets and other objects.

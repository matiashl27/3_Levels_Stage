## Power up the station {pagestep}

To power up your station you will need two 5V/3A power supplies: one with a [USB-C connector][Raspberry Pi Power Supply]{qty:1} for the Raspberry Pi and one with a [male 5.5x2.1mm jack connector][Strobe Power Supply]{qty:1} for the strobe illumination.

Use a [voltage regulator][Voltage regulator]{qty:1} to supply 3V to the strobe. Higher voltage can damage it.

## Software set-up {pagestep}

Setting up the software is included in the next section of instructions. It is detailed in ["Software Installation" page]. Using the software is described in the ["Use your Station" page].

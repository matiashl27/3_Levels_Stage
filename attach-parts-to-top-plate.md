## Prepare the top plate {pagestep}

* Positionate a [heat-set insert][Heat-set insert]{qty:4} for each corner of the [top plate][Top plate](fromstep){qty:1}.
* Apply heat to the [insert][Heat-set insert] (using a [soldering iron][Soldering iron]{qty:1}) and use gentle force to push it into position as decribed in the [guide to use heat-set inserts].
* Repeat this step to put two more [inserts][Heat-set insert]{qty:2} in the plate to attach the focusing assembly.

## Prepare the standoffs {pagestep}

* Insert a [M3x10mm cap head screw]{qty: 4} into each [standoff][Standoff-M](fromstep){qty: 4, cat:printedpart} using the large hole that comes out the side of the [standoff][Standoff-M]. The screw should poke out the end of the part as shown.
* Use a [2.5mm ball-ended hex key][2.5mm Ball-end Allen key]{qty:1} to turn the screw.

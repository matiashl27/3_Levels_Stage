## Set your laser cutting machine settings {pagestep}

Laser-cutting acrylics is relatively simple. The basic steps for achieving good-quality cut acrylic parts are listed [here].

Settings for laser cutting acrylics will vary according to the machine. The table below lists the settings we used: 

|Setting     |Value        |
|------------|--           |
|Material    |Acrylic 5mm |
|Power (W)   |50 |
|Speed (mm/s)|10 |

We recommend testing the parameters for acrylic laser cutting using a test matrix. Download and laser cut the [test matrix](parts/materials/test-matrix.md) file. This will only use about an 8x9x0.5cm acrylic sheet.

The result should look like this:

Now you have tested your [laser cutting machine][Laser cutting machine]{qty: 1} and [acrylic sheet][52x18x0.5cm Acrylic sheet]{Qty: 1} you can laser cut the following parts:

* [Top plate]{output,qty:1} (17x17x0.5cm): [top-plate.dxf](parts/materials/top-plate.md)
* [Middle plate]{output,qty:1} (17x17x0.5cm): [middle-plate.dxf](parts/materials/middle-plate.md)
* [Bottom plate]{output,qty:1} (17x17x0.5cm): [bottom-plate.dxf](parts/materials/bottom-plate.md)

### Remove film

* If there is protective film on the acrylic, remove it now.

* Your plates are now prepared and ready to use.

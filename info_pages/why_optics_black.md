# Why print the optics module or lens spacer in black?

The optics module or lens spacer is used to separate the imaging optics from the camera sensor. In an ideal microscope the only light that reaches the camera sensor should be the light focused by these optics. 

We can limit reflected light using black filament. This will absorb more of the stray light. Black filament is also more opaque than other filaments. This means that less light will be transmitted through the walls of the optics module.

# Why is strobe illumination needed for droplets microfluidics?

The small size and high speed of droplets moving through microfluidic devices create particular challenges for an imaging system based on low-cost and open-source components.

Stroboscopic imaging is an interesting technique that ‘freezes’ the motion of a fast-moving object. The light source needs to be synchronized with the objects to be inspected, and the camera is triggered at the exact moment of the light pulse.

In the Open Microfluidics Workstation, we are able to do that with a high-power LED and a Raspberry Pi camera.

# Strobe-Enhanced Microfluidic Workstation

The Strobe-Enhanced Microfluidics Workstation is a free and open-source workstation for bioimaging of fast processes. It supports using the lens from the Raspberry Pi Camera to produce a microscope with a field of view of about 950μm and a strobe based on a high-power LED for imaging fast-moving objects. This design is inspired by open-source hardware such as the [OpenFlexure flat-top microscope](https://rwb27.gitlab.io/openflexure-flat-top-microscope/ ""){:target="_blank"}.

## Instructions

These instructions will take you through how to assemble the 2-levels version of the workstation. There is also a [3-levels version](https://librehub.github.io/3_Levels_Stage/ ""){:target="_blank"} if you need a room for placing your boards and protected them.

Before you start building the workstation you will need to source all the components listed our [bill of materials](index_BOM.md) [(csv)](index_BOM.csv).

The assembly is broken up into several steps:

1. [Print the plastic parts](printing.md "")
1. [Laser cut the acrylic parts](laser-cutting.md "")
1. [3D models ](testpage1.md "")
1. [Building](testpage2.md "")
1. [Screen holder](testpage5.md "")
1. [Electronics Assembly](Information.md "")
1. [Codes](testpage3.md "")

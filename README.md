# Strobe-enhanced microscopy stage for microfluidic droplet generation [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

The strobe-enhanced microscopy stage is a free and open-source workstation for imaging fast processes, particularly developed for microfluidic droplet generation. It uses the lens from the Raspberry Pi Camera to produce a microscope with a field of view of almost 1mm and a strobe illumination based on a high-power LED for imaging fast-moving objects. Custom electronics allow the synchronization between the LED and the camera to capture sharp images of fast-moving droplets and other objects.

> **Note:** Most parts of this stage are original designs, and some items were modified from the open-source hardware [OpenFlexure flat-top microscope](https://rwb27.gitlab.io/openflexure-flat-top-microscope/), this includes some elements on this page and in the assembly instructions.

### How do I edit the documentation?

To edit the documentation you do not need to install anything, but you will need to
install something to build the final version of the documentation (such as a website).
The documentation files can be opened in a plain text editor such as Windows Notepad,
Notepad++, gedit, VS Code, etc. GitBuilding also comes with a browser-based editor that
displays has a live display of the final HTML documentation.

If you have ever used [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) you will
notice that the files you are editing are markdown files. GitBuilding uses an extended
markdown syntax (that we call BuildUp). This allows you to keep track of parts in the
documentation. More detail on the documentation is available on the
[GitBuilding website](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/). There is also additional
[syntax for configuration](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/buildconfsyntax), and for
[part libraries](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/builduplibrary/).

# Utility knife

Any standard utility knife should work for simple jobs like removing a brim.


Any retractable or fixed blade untility knife should work. This is probably safer than scalpel, but should still be used with caution! A Stanley Titan fixed blade knife is a high quality option with replaceable blades that are fixed rather than retractable.

# Precision wire cutters
![](../../images/Precision-wire-cutters.jpg)

Precision wire cutters, sometimes called flush cutters, are wire cutters which come to a sharp point and have a flat back surface. This allows small wires (or 3D printed supports) to be be cut flush against another surface. These are very useful for removing small 3D printed ties used to hold the microscope together during printing.
